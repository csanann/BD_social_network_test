# This is Database 7: Test Driving Database write Operations
This project is practical implementation of the challenge: Social_Network Challenge.
I have built a simple social network application that demonstrates the user of TDD for database write operations, including creating, updating and deleting records.

## Purpose and Goal
The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of:
- Test-driving write operations in a database
- Performing unit tests and integration tests for database interactions
- Structuring the codebase in a clear and organized manner
By completing the work, I have improved my skills in implementing TDD for database write operations, ensuring that the code is reliable, maintainable, and well-organized. 

## What I learned
Throughout the work, I learned:
- How to write uni tests for various database operations such as creating, updating, and deleting records.
- How to write integration tests to ensure that the application's components work together correctly.
- the importance of proper code organization and separation of concerns for maintainability and scalability.
- How to handle common database errors and edge cases, improving the robustness of the application.

## Project structure
The work is structured with the following key components:
- 'User' and 'Post' classes: These classes represent the user and post entities in the social network application.
- 'UserRepository' and 'PostRepository': These repository classes handle the interactions with the database for the 'User' and 'Post' classes.
-unit tests: Located in the 'spec' folder, these tests ensure that hte components of the application, ensuring that each piece works as expected in isolation.
-Integration tests: It located in the 'spec' folder, the test ensures that the components of the applications work together correctly, providing the desired functionality.
